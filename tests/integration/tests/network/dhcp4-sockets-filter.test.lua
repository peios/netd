-- netd TRM §5.6 — what the DHCPv4 packet socket lets through: its classic
-- BPF filter passes only an unfragmented IPv4 UDP datagram addressed to
-- port 68: both the more-fragments flag and fragment offset must be zero.
-- The don't-fragment flag is allowed (PEI-1370).
--
-- The gateway's DHCP server answers no DISCOVER here; the test answers by
-- hand, with OFFER frames built byte by byte, so each one can be wrong in
-- exactly one way. Every OFFER is a correct answer to the DISCOVER it
-- follows (its xid, the machine's chaddr, a server identifier, a lease),
-- so the only reason netd could have for ignoring it is the one under
-- test. The proof that an OFFER was ignored is not a quiet interval but
-- the client's next DISCOVER with the same xid: a client that had taken
-- the OFFER would have sent a REQUEST instead and left Selecting. The
-- positive control is the same OFFER, sent correctly, drawing a REQUEST.
-- REQUESTs are NAKed, which puts the client straight back in Selecting
-- with a new DISCOVER.
--
-- Its own pair: the client must be in Selecting from its first DISCOVER,
-- and stay there, which no shared file can promise.
